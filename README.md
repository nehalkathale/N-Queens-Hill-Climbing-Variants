## Problem Statement ##
The N-Queens Problem consists of placing N queens on an NxN chessboard so that no two queens can capture each other. That is, no two queens are allowed to be placed on the same row, the same column or the same diagonal. The problem of finding all solutions to the 8-queens problem can be quite computationally expensive. In this project, you will experiment with the n-queens problem by using hill-climbing search and its variants. Your program should treat the number of queens as a variable and should allow the user to input the value of queens. Using a programming language of your choice, implement the followings:
1. Hill climbing search
2. Hill-climbing search with sideways move
3. Random-restart hill-climbing with and without sideways move
## Steps to run the program: ##
* Clone this repository
* Run project
* Enter number of queens
* Select Hill Climbing variant
1. N - Queens Hill Climbing Search
2. N - Queens Hill Climbing search with Sideway Moves
3. N - Queens Random Restart Hill Climbing search without Sideway Moves
4. N - Queens Random Restart Hill Climbing search with Sideway Moves
* Ouput will be displayed with initial state and final state
